For the first week both theoretical and practical work are done.

### Theoretical
<b>Aim:</b> To understand how LLMs work

Our team engaged in an in-depth discussion and [presentation](./What_is_LLM.pdf) addressing key foundational questions about LLMs, including:
* How does LLMs differ from simpler NLP models?
* How does Transformer architecture work?
* What are the steps involved in pre-training and fine-tuning an LLM?
* How does tokenization work?
* What are embeddings, and how do they represent language in LLMs?
* How are LLMs evaluated?
* What are real-world applications of LLMs?

### Practical
* Each team member developed a basic LLM application using the LangChain framework, providing hands-on experience with the platform.
* Gained a solid understanding of the framework's fundamentals and became familiar with key concepts and terminologies.
